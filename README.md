# text-adjust-night-mode
This demo gives the user an opportunity to change the font-size of the page's articles by clicking any of the three buttons - 
'smaller', 'normal', and 'larger'. Users could also switch to night mode by the click of a button which listens to two events: 
firstly: onclick, the screen becomes dark, and ondblclick, the screen goes back to deafult day mode.
